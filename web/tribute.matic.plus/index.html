        <h3>Here is a timeline of Salvador Dalí:</h1>
        <ul>
        <li><b>1904</b> Born on 11 May in Figueres (Girona). Son of the notary public Salvador Dalí Cusí and his wife Felipa Domènech Ferrés.</li>
        <li><b>1916</b> Salvador spent periods on the outskirts of Figueres, at the Molí de la Torre estate owned by the Pichot family, a family of intellectuals and artists; it was there, through the collection owned by the painter Ramon Pichot, that he discovered Impressionism.</li>
        <li><b>1920</b> If he were set on becoming a painter, his father made it a condition that he go to Madrid to study at the Fine Arts School, in order to qualify as a teacher. Dalí accepted to do so.</li>
        <li><b>1925</b> He took part in the First Exhibition of the Iberian Artists Society in Madrid</li>
      <li><b>1926</b> He participated in several exhibitions in Madrid and Barcelona. In the company of his aunt and his sister, he made his first trip to Paris, where he met Picasso.</li>
      <li><b>1929</b> He travelled again to Paris and, through Joan Miró, came into contact with the group of surrealists headed by André Breton. The film Un chien andalou was shown at Paris' Studio des Ursulines, being the fruit of his collaboration with Luis Buñuel. </li>
      <li><b>1930 </b>L'âge d'or (The Age of Gold), the second film he made in collaboration with Buñuel, had its first performance at Studio 28 in Paris. </li>
      <li><b>1940</b> When the German troops entered Bordeaux, the Dalí couple went to live in the United States, where they were to remain until 1948.</li>
      <li><b>1945</b> He went to Hollywood to work with Alfred Hitchcock on the film Spellbound, whose dreamlike sequences were created by Dalí. The Bignou Gallery inaugurated the exhibition Recent Paintings by Salvador Dalí. This served as the occasion for Dalí to present the first volume of Dali News, which he published himself and which dealt solely with the artist and his oeuvre.</li>
      <li><b>1958</b> On August 8th Dalí and Gala were married at the Els Àngels shrine in Sant Martí Vell, near Girona.</li>
      <li><b>1983</b> A major anthological exhibition, 400 works by Salvador Dalí from 1914 to 1983, was held in Madrid, Barcelona and Figueres. His last pictorial works date from this period.</li>
        <li><b>1989</b> Dalí died in Figueres on 23 January 1989. A major retrospective exhibition Salvador Dalí, 1904-1989 was held at the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, and was shown later at the Kunsthaus in Zurich.</li>
